<p>I finally looked into starting a website after listening to the combination of people 
asking me whether I sold any of the items I made, or rather, how I learned to create them 
in the first place. After having a few friends over to the shop to help them create projects
of their own, I finally decided to put something together.<br><br> This site is alive to serve a
couple different purposes. First, I absolutely love working in the shop; it's my own personal form
of therapy. For those without the tools and know-how, I would love to make these pieces for them.
Second and foremost, if someone wants to give the craft a shot themselves, I wanted to create a
small hub of education for them; simple projects, how to get started, and a place to ask questions
or be inspired.</p>
